XBRL Validation Tool Audit
===========================

Scope
-----
This document tracks the current capabilities, gaps, and changes made while integrating full EBA taxonomy package loading and robust Arelle-based validations.

Current State (initial)
-----------------------
- Core validation engine: Arelle via arelle-release (CntlrCmdLine) with JSONL logging wrapper in `src/validation/arelle_runner.py`.
- API workflow: `api/server.py` supports end-to-end validation with cache priming, DTS load, validation, filing checks, DPM mapping, and report generation.
- GUI: `gui/xbrl_validator_app.py` provides a single UI surface to run validations and visualize results. It currently shells out to `app.validate` and ingests JSONL; fallback path will be added to run validations in-process when CLI is unavailable.
- Config: Taxonomy stacks are referenced via `config/taxonomy.json` (present in API). Dedicated sources and profiles files will be added.
- Outputs: JSONL logs and exports (CSV/JSON/Excel/PDF) generated by the reporting pipeline.

Gaps (to address)
------------------
- Ensure EBA taxonomy packages are acquired and cached under `assets/taxonomies/` with checksums.
- Provide reproducible setup script `scripts/setup_taxonomies.sh` and configuration under `config/taxonomy_sources.json` and `config/validation_profiles.json`.
- Guarantee full formula execution and package loading with `--packages` or `zip#entry` syntax and offline cache priming when requested.
- Align GUI to run validations even when the legacy `app.validate` CLI is unavailable; produce exports for download buttons.

Planned Work
------------
- Add taxonomy setup script and configs, update `.gitignore` for binaries.
- Implement GUI fallback to in-process validation; wire report generation.
- Add sample validation runner script and performance measurement hooks.

Changelog
---------
- [Init] Created audit.md, parity.md skeletons and taxonomy setup scaffolding.
